Readability: It's a short class, but it makes sense. It makes a new coin at a certain position and
it exists for a small period of time. There is much more to coins in Mario anyways. It's clear though
that these coins are from lucky blocks and aren't just sitting around the world.

Maintainability: Since it is such a small class, it wouldn't be hard to make changes. Possibly adding some value to
distinguish overworld coins versus luckyblock coins. That way the overworld coins exist and only disappear
when they are interacted with.

All in all Sanaa did a good job.
