Readability:
Overall, the code is very readable. Dylan uses a limited amount of magical numbers and those that are used are defined along the top
so that the reader knows what the values are representing. Dylan also managed to keep the class relatively short under 70 lines which is good. Other
than the constructor, there are 3 methods which all serve relevant uses in drawing, updating and getting the destination of the sprite. The return statement for the getDestination method could be made shorter 
if I was being nitpicky. 


Code Quality: 
Overall, the code is pretty high quality. It makes use of it's qualititative factors over quantity or extensive lines of code. The variable names, such as the animationTimer and FrameRectangles
are very descriptive and relevant. All of the methods are also used enough to be necessary but not too much to be redundant or produce "code smells."

Hypothetical Changes: 
Some values like "0f" could've been preassigned to further limit the use of magic numbers but those are few and far between.

Overall, Dylan did a great job
