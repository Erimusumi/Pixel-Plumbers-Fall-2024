Readability: 
This is quite short class rather than the level one because there are not that many block, obstacle and enemy sprites.
There are instance variables for this class at the first part with the relevant naming, and it has constructor at the second part.
It assign the instance variable with the right texture using textureManager.
Third part was initializeLevel and load level using layer classes.
It also have update and draw class, and last part is floorRectangle for the ground.
With the clear naming and code, it was readable.

Maintainability: As I said before, the structure of the level two was similar with level one, and the structure was maintainable with clear sections in this class as I sad before.
It used textureManager and stateMachine in constructor, and update and draw all the things relevantly.
