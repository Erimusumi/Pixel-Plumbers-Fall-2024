Readability
The method names used are very clear and follow the C# naming conventions. However, I would consider renaming upBlock to 
ActivateBlock or LiftBlock to clarify what the code is meant to do, since the action "up" could be ambiguous without context. 
Also, the methods in the interface and class are mostly empty, so I would consider using NotImplemented Exception to indicate 
if they are or aren't placeholders, or at least put comments to explain the code's intended functionality.

Maintainability
There are several empty methods in this class and if the methods are meant as placeholders for future implementation, the use of 
NotImplementedException would be a clear indicator of the method's status. Also, I would consider adding a SpriteBatch parameter 
to methods like drawBlock to be able to accept graphics-related arguments which would make the method more versatile.

StarObjectClass.cs
Sanaa Kamau
20 minutes

Readability
The method names such as star, idleState, and collectedState are relatively clear, but I would consider changing the name star
because it might not effectively communicate the purpose of the method in the class. Also, I would suggest using the alias bool
instead of Boolean within the code to improve consistency with C# coding conventions.

Maintainability
The implementation of StarObjectClass is fairly straightforward as it manages two states, idle and collected. To improve 
maintainability I would include a constructor to initialize the idle and collected states to prevent any unintended behavior 
if the states are accessed before being initialized. Also, I would consider implementing a method to change the state of collected 
because aat the moment the code only allows for idle to be set to false which could leave collected in an indeterminate state.
