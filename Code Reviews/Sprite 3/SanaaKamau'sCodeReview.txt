Readability
I'd say that the Goomba2 class is overall very readable. The class doesn't contain
an excessive amount of lines of code. At a basic level, any reader could look at the 
methods and guess what they do as they're highly descriptive. I think it might be helpful
to change the name of the class from Goomba2 to something else as there's a Goomba and Goomba2 
class and can be difficult at face value to discern the actual difference between the two.

Maintainability
I think the Goomba2 class is fairly maintainable as the class has a limited amount of
hard code, it's easy to add methods or change the functionality.
