Readability Comments:
Most variable and method names are descriptive to be readable. I would say the code is readable, but 
without already being familiar with the reader and string methods, it took me a few minutes to parse 
what was going on in this class. A comment about what the loops and conditionals are checking for and 
doing would help a lot if others ever need to work with this code. Also, the single character variable
names confused me. I thought they were just loop iteration variables at first, but it looks like
they represent x/y coordinates for reading/writing from the csv to the tile array. If that's the case,
a longer, more descriptive name would be helpful.


Maintainability Comments:Â 
Class is set up in a way where individual numbers can be tweaked or different files can be loaded
for different levels. This class seems perfect to already work with all maps, but wouldn't seem
very hard to rework/reuse in different contexts. Good job!
