Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 
Firstly, I thought it is a good code because the lines of codes are not that long for this class.
For the update class, which is the main method to handle collision between Mario and Enemy, he uses methods in Mario class and Enemy Class.
This makes the codes simple and readable.
Implementing methods to change the state of the Enemy and Mario within the enemy and mario classes in advance is optimal way to handle collision I think.
He efficiently use those methods, and handle the collision successfully.
However, there is only single situation that can occur by the collision in this class.
He made enemy be stomped when collision happens.
I believe it will be the better way if he handled this collision differently depends the different Mario state.
There is no dead state of Mario even though mario take damage from the enemy.
