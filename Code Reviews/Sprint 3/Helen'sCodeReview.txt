Readability
The method names used in Fireball are pretty clear and easy to read. Sometimes magic numbers like 2, 200, and 400f are 
used which could be replaced with constants with more descriptive names like const int HorizontalMovementSpeed = 2. 
Code structure-wise I think that the Move method could be separated into 2 distinct methods to separate horizontal movement 
from vertical movement just to make it more readable and maintainable. Instead, having a MoveHorizontally() and 
a MoveVertically() method might be easier to read.

Maintainability
Since the Fireball class does multiple things like moving, bouncing, updating, etc. it might be beneficial to break down 
some of the functionalities into separate classes if the functions get more complex. For example, creating a separate 
collision handler might be good to have a more indepth collision detection system so that the code is more maintainable.
