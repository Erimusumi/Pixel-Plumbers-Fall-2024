Readability: It seems pretty straight forward. The class has a MoveRight, MoveLeft, and a SwapDirection method, 
At first glance this seems counterintuitive but it's to add the turning animation. I feel it could be more compressed
into one or two methods instead of 3. Maybe passing an int or boolean value for if left and right is pressed to have the
swap animation. fireballTimer += -1; in update is fine. I just find it interesting that += -1 was the choice of 
how to decrement the timer instead of -= 1. I think both work and there is no problem with it, it's just interesting.
This class isn't that hard to understand I'd say.

Maintainability: I'd say the code is very maintainable. One thing that will need to be changed in the future is 
the number of fireballs. That just means ShootFireball will have to know the number of fireballs on the screen and
it will be an extra condition in the if. That is super easy to change. It's the same with the other methods. If
something happens only when facing right but not left, that would just have to be added to the one method. Though if
something happens in both directions it would have to be added to both methods.

I believe Arun did a good job on this class.
