Comment:
I firstly like the name of this class because it clearly represent what kind of block it is.
If we have so many classes and many kind of blocks, team members might struggle to distinguish that what kind of block is associated with this cs file without clear name.
For the most of the instance variables, it I was clearly readable.
However, the instance name Start and End was little ambiguous what this variable represent.
I could see that those variables are related to the width and height, but I think it is not readable enough.

Comment:
She use constructor to get ItemTexture from the game1 class.
For the draw method, she pass the position variable to get the destination position.
It is good in terms that this class is nothing to do with the game1 class.
Surely, this class should get some variables from game 1 class, but this class never access to the game 1 class because constructor does not have game 1 as parameter.
Hypothetical change:
She made another controller to iterate items, however, I think it can be merged with the keyboardController that already exist for the maintainability and simpleness.
