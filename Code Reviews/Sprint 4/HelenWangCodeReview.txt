Readability
The class as descriptive method names like updateEnemyFalling, updateItemFalling, and updateMarioFalling which are clear 
and convey their purpose well making it easy to understand what the methods are doing. Also, the class separates the logic 
for enemies, items, and Mario which make it easier to follow what the code is doing. To make the code more readable the magic 
numbers could be changed out for constant values to make it easier to understand what the numbers are for. Also, the logic for 
updateEnemyFalling and updateItemFalling contain almost identical logic, maybe there is a way to condense it to make the code 
easier to read and maintain. 

Maintainability
The class has a clear structure with dedicated methods for handling different objects which make it easy to add or modify 
behavior for specific object types. To improve maintainability, the boolean flag marioIsColliding could be deleted because 
marioIsColliding is already being set to true inside the loop and is later checked after the loop to reset it.
