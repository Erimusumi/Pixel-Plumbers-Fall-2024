Maintainability
This code seems very maintainable. It follows a fairy simple structure. It has a simple contructor, followed by two functions.
The functions are simple, and the constructor only locates the sound from content and adds it to the list. The current method
just simply returns the first list in the song, and next song treats the list as a queue, removing the first song and adding it
to the back of the list.

Overall, this class is very maintainable, nothing too difficult to follow or keep track of. One concern that could arise is that
as more music needs to be added, the constructor could grow exponentially long since you're manually adding all the songs into the
list there. I don't see any other way to prevent this though.
