Maintainability
Basically, this class is maintainable I believe.
She handles the ground collision with ground class and list of entities.
Most of the ground collisions were handled by the methods that was already initialized within mario, item or enemy classes.
Most of the methods were simple and maintainable.

Readability
This class was readable and easy to understand that what is the purpose of this class.
There were three cases that this class should handle.
Each method handles mario falling case, enemy falling case, and item falling case respectively.
Therefore, the structure of this class was pretty simple and understandable.
