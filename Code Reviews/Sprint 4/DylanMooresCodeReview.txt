Levels -> LevelOne.cs

Readability: It seems really easy to read to me. screen never seems to get used and I'm not sure what it's 
for though. I also noticed that DrawLevel has a something called camera which isn't used. I like the
extraction of all the enemies and blocks here for the level. I wonder if extracting it out once more would
be better or not. It's also clear to me that all the enemies and blocks are added to the IEntity list to
be checked for with collisions. Though that's probably because I'm also a developer on the project.
It also is a good idea to have the update and draw methods here so draw in Game1 isn't huge.

Maintainability: I almost wonder if making a seprate updates/draw for blocks would be useful. This class
is very maintainable so it wouldn't be difficult to achieve. It also wouldn't be difficult to add or remove
enemies/blocks. I think the most difficult part is finding the raw numbers for where each block and enemy goes. 
The class isn't to complicated or difficult to add/remove to.

All in all Arun did a good job.
