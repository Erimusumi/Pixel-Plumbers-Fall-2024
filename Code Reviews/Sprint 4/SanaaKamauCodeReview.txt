Levels -> LevelOne.cs

Readability: It seems really easy to read to me. screen never seems to get used and I'm not sure what it's 
for though. I also noticed that DrawLevel has a something called camera which isn't used. I like the
extraction of all the enemies here for the level. I also like the idea that blocks are going to be added here
as well, more specifically I assume lucky blocks with specific items. It's also clear to me that all the
enemies are added to the IEntity list to be checked for with collisions. Though that's probably because
I'm also a developer on the project. It also is a good idea to have the update and draw methods here so draw
in Game1 isn't huge.

Maintainability: I almost wonder if making a seprate updates/draw for blocks would be useful. This class
is very maintainable so it wouldn't be difficult to achieve. It also wouldn't be difficult to add or remove
enemies. I think the most difficult part is finding the raw numbers for where each block and enemy goes. 
The class isn't to complicated or difficult to add/remove to.

All in all Arun did a good job.
