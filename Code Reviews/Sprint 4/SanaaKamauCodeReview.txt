Readability:
The class is pretty readable for the most part. Variable names are pretty descriptive overall. I would recommend renaming the table and top enum state values because
reading them intuitively can be a bit confusing. (what does it mean for the current state to be table? top?) I would also reorder some of the methods so that reading them
top to bottom is a little more organized. The class is less than 120 lines which also aids in its' readability. 

Maintainability:
The class seems fairly maintainable.The methods individually are pretty simplistic; sticking to their own respective tasks. The private variables for the class are also very general,
so they can easily be used for a different purpose of play if need be. 

Overall, Dylan did a great job with the BlackJackStateMachine class. Its' simplistic enough to be easy to read yet simultaneously carries a lot of functionality.
