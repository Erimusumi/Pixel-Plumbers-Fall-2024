Readable: 
Overall the code is very readable. It's easy to make out the intent behind all of the mario states. The names are
relevant given their functions and provide aid to the readibility. 


Code Quality: 
The decorated mario class is also used in this class, as well as
other classes which proves to be resuable for other classes such as starMario. The states
are simplistic and straight to the point. Function bodies for states or precise.

Hypothetical change: 
I noticed the game class is being passed in, which can be prevented, making for a more centric distribution of
what classes inherit/make use of others explicitly. Perhaps also, if the sprites were more organized, there wouldn't 
be a need to reiterate every repeated state for Mario's different powerups. For example, the base mario, star mario and
fire mario all have methods regarding the states such as crouching, standing left/right, swimming etc. An automated system
could be used to match up the sprites, however each powerup has different abilities also so there's bound to be some reiteration.
